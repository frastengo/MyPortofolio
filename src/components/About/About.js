                    <p>Iâ€™m originally from <span>Chile </span>and have been living in the United States for about 16 years. I am proficient in both English and Spanish. My professional career was focused on the health industry which led me to positions that strengthen my customer service skills, time management, and proficiency.

                <p>
                    During that journey, I realized that I was very interested and enjoyed the use of technology and computer software which is what trigger the decision to start exploring <span>coding</span>. I started with resources online that then led me to a three month program from Code Academy, Build Websites From Scratch. This amazing experience made me realized that I wanted to become a <span>Web Developer</span> and it is why I decided to attend DevMountain coding boot camp. I absolutely loved it and I truly believed I have found my passion. I am now ready to continue to explore, learn, and <span> expand my skills.</span>
